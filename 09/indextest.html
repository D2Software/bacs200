                The Wild Animal Sanctuary (TWAS) is a place where abused and mistreated predators from around the world find refuge.  They current have over 10K acres of space over two locations housing over 520 animals ranging from lions to tigers to bears <strong><em>OH MY!</em></strong>  This is a place where these animals can roam freely in habitats that range from 5 to 25 acres, much better than the 10 by 10 cells some of these creatures are rescued from.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The situations these poor animals come from can be horrendous.  Some of their stories start off seemingly innocent enough, like a baby tiger purchased as a pet.  How about a caged animal attraction at a highway gas station.  Or a federal foreign government steps in to close a zoo in another country.  In all of these stories TWAS has been the first to put up their hand and take in the mistreated animals.  Sometimes they are called on by name, as they are one of, if not, the largest sanctuary for predators in the world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When new animals are brought to TWAS there is a specific, and less stressfull way to introduce them to the TWAS residents.  First they are looked over in a smaller enclosure generally twice the size of what they were use to.  During their rehabilitation the animals are paired with others of their species so they can enjoy their new lease on life with others of their species.  This is accomplished in different stages of the rehabilitation in a variety of different habitats. Once they are confortable with their new surroundings they are moved to a large habitat with their new found friends and can live out their lives in peace. TWAS prides itself on making each transition with as little stress as possible.
